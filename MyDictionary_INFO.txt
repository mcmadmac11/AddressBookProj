Create a dictionary contact book 
    
The key will be the name of a contact and the value will be a phone number

Create classes and functions to use the address book

Make sure to override and overload functions. Be prepared to explain why you used it in the way that you did. 

Overload an operator in some way

Don’t be afraid to use an interface or abstract class (practice makes perfect!)

Tip: An interface should begin with a capital ‘I’. Ex: IPart or IMovable
